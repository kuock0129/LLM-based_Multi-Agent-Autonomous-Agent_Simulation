# LLM-based Multi-Agent Autonomous Agent Simulation Platform  

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a **multi-agent autonomous simulation platform** leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for dynamic environment generation and agent behavior control. The system will demonstrate real-time agent movement, interactions, and decision-making in a virtual environment, utilizing sensors, collision handling, and user inputs for seamless simulation.  

## Objectives  

### 1. Automated Agent Behavior in a Dynamic Environment  
- Implement **autonomous agent movement** with realistic physics-based controls.  
- Agents will navigate the environment, responding to gravity, obstacles, and interactions.  
- Pathfinding and decision-making will be integrated based on predefined logic or real-time LLM-based reasoning.  

### 2. Multi-Agent Interaction via Sensors, Collision Handling, and User Input  
- Utilize **sensors and collision handlers** to enable realistic agent interactions.  
- Implement **keyboard and input-based controls** for manual and autonomous movement.  
- Enable **agent-to-agent interactions**, such as cooperative or competitive behavior.  

### 3. Procedural Environment Generation via LLM Inquiry  
- The environment will be dynamically generated using **JSON files** produced from **LLM-based natural language inquiries**.  
- Users can describe the environment (e.g., “A city with roads and obstacles”), and the system will generate a structured JSON representation.  
- The generated environment will include **platforms, obstacles, interactive elements, and NPCs**.  

## Technical Stack  
- **Simulation Engine:** Enviro (for physics, movement, and multi-agent control)  
- **Networking:** Multi-user real-time synchronization (e.g., WebSockets, Enviro’s networking layer)  
- **LLM Integration:** GPT-based models for dynamic environment generation  
- **Data Format:** JSON-based world description and configuration  

## Expected Outcomes  
- A **fully interactive** multi-agent platform demonstrating **autonomous movement, decision-making, and real-time interactions**.  
- A **multi-user experience**, where players can control or observe agents in the dynamically generated environment.  
- A **procedurally generated simulation space**, allowing natural language commands to define the world and its agents.
